1.  Ask user if he wants to deploy contract or not
  if(yes) ->  <make user the head principal
              <create account for user with 1000 network tokens
              <launch contract
              <create new token with supply=100,000
  if(no)  ->  <create account for user with 1000 network tokens
              <display account content
              <ask for contract address for already deployed contract 
              <connect user to contract

        loop{ //terminate this loop when there aren't anymore n-n-tokens to sell

          loop{
              <display to user price of non-network token w.r.t network token
              <ask user for how many n-n-tokens they want to purchase
              <if number of tokens they want to buy exceeds number of tokens available, restaert loop, else move on to next part of program
          }
              <update price of n-n-token using equation
              <transfer n-n-token to user and n-token to contract
              <update omega user about this transaction
              <display normal-user account content (showing n-n-token) to normal user
        }
            Transfer n-tokens to omega user
